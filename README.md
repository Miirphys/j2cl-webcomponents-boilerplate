**J2cl WebComponent boilerplate**

In recent years, after a long gestation period , web components have gradually gained in power.
I first experimented it with the release of polymer, but finally found that the rendering time
of the components was not fast enough for my needs and the framework itself too heavy.

But today the latest webkit implementation of the webcomponents specification is lightning fast
and does not require any framework .  

I was convinced after my last tests that this technology is the direction to follow .

The only question i was left with , was if I would finally bring myself
to use javascript. In fact, the latest versions of javascript are very interesting.
But as a long time java developer, JS is still too messy for my taste ,
even with notions of class and inheritance .

Fortunately , google has released the J2cl compiler 2 years ago .
After a year of experimenting with j2cl, I started wanting to find shortcuts in this technology.

**This is where this project comes from.**
