Simple boilerplate for webcomponents with j2cl 


Here is my attempt to make a very simple boilerplate to implements WebComponents using the google j2cl compiler .

Each template can be declared externaly as a simple HTML file and linked to the right component using the @WebComponent 
annotation 

@see https://github.com/eponthiaux/j2cl-webcomponents-boilerplate/blob/main/boilerplate/button/src/main/java/com/github/epoth/client/components/Button.java

and 

@see https://github.com/eponthiaux/j2cl-webcomponents-boilerplate/blob/main/boilerplate/button/src/main/java/com/github/epoth/client/components/Button.html

Event binding beetween template and component are entirely generated .
